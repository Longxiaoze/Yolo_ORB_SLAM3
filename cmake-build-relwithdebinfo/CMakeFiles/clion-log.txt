CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:53 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrealsense2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "realsense2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "realsense2" with
  any of the following names:

    realsense2Config.cmake
    realsense2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "realsense2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "realsense2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "realsense2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

CMake Deprecation Warning at Thirdparty/g2o/CMakeLists.txt:1 (CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
